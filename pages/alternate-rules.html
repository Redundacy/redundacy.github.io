    <h1>New Rules</h1>
    The full list is as follows.

    <h2>Command</h2>
    <h3>New Bonus Action</h3>
    <p>
        Some spells and magic items use the bonus action to command creatures. I think it's inconsistent, so here's the rule: you must use your bonus action to COMMAND all summoned creatures. You give all your commands during this part, but they don't have to all be the same command for each creature.

        Additionally, you can attempt to command anything. Imagine you have recently broken out some hostages from a bandit lord's lair. When you enter combat, you can manage the helpless folks with the COMMAND action.
    </p>

    <h2>Double Tap</h2>
    <h3>Combat Effect</h3>
    <p>
        This rule replaces the Cleave optional rule to create an additional "area coverage" opportunity for melee attackers. Once each turn when you reduce a creature's hit points to zero with a melee weapon attack and deal excess damage, you may expend all remaining speed to make another melee weapon attack against another creature. Instead of adding the normal modifier to the damage roll, add the excess damage dealt to the previous creature.
    </p>

    <h2>Hiding in Combat</h2>
    <h3>Combat Rule</h3>
    <p>
        Somewhere I learned about cool hiding rules and here's what I think of them.

        In order to hide, you have to have a place to hide. You can get creative with it, but you might impose some penalties towards your stealth check.
    </p>

    <h2>Skill Checks in Combat</h2>
    <h3>Combat Rule</h3>
    <p>
        As a general rule, you can make one skill check for free on your turn. The notable exceptions are stealth (the Hide action already exists) and active perception (idk about this one, but dragons have to do it so players might have to as well).

        I'll also sometimes ask for skill checks during another creature's turn. When potential information is relevant, you might roll one of the intelligence skill checks to realize what it is (knowing what you're using your Counterspell on is important).
    </p>

    <h2>Special Skill Checks</h2>
    <h3>Team Checks</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes the entire party needs to make a skill check at the same time. In this case, a "Team Check" means that the party will succeed if half of the group succeeds.
    </p>
    <h3>Duo Checks</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes two characters need to make a skill check in a way that helping might not be as lucrative. In this case, a "Duo Check" means that the DC might climb higher than normal, but each character contributes to the check. Modifiers are added for each character, and someone might already have advantage. It's cool
    </p>
    <h3>Tool Checks</h3>
    <p>
        Xanathar's guide has some rules about using tools for interesting skill checks. Somewhere I once read that you would add your proficiency on top of a check that used a given tool. That kinda ruins thieves' tools checks but... sometimes I might ask for a "skill + tool" check, where you would add both. As far as I know you can't get expertise on tools other than thieves' tools, so this should be fine.
    </p>

    <h2>Targeted Conditions</h2>
    <h3>hiding isn't written well</h3>
    <p>
        Conditions are weird. This helps some conditions work better. 

        You can be "Afraid of" another creature, or multiple creatures. If they surround you, you would be essentially paralyzed with fear.

        You can be "Hidden from" a single creature but not others. 
    </p>

    <h2>Wearing Magic Armor</h2>
    <h3>Magic Items</h3>
    <p>
        Magic armor takes up one of four slots on your body. Head, Chest, Arms, and Legs. Generic +1/2/3 armor represents all unfilled slots. Any other full armor set does the same. This means that as long as one of the four slots is unfilled, your unslotted armor class exists.

        Flavorfully, the attunement to magic armor includes stitching it to your existing armor (through magic means and stuff). You can also sprinkle flavor on the equip time that is required for many armor sets, explaining how the magic items wrap around you or something like that.
